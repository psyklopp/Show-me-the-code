# üêã Docker for Dummies

I have used Docker but never bothered to go through the official documentation. After reading the following pages, I can definitely say that the concepts are much more clear!

## What is a container?
A container is a sandboxed process running on a host machine that is isolated from all other processes running on that host machine.

According to [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/workshop/), a container:

- Is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.
- Can be run on local machines, virtual machines, or deployed to the cloud.
- Is portable (and can be run on any OS).
- Is isolated from other containers and runs its own software, binaries, configurations, etc.

## What is an image?

A running container uses an isolated filesystem. This isolated filesystem is provided by an image

The image must contain everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configurations, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains other configurations for the container, such as environment variables, a default command to run, and other metadata.
